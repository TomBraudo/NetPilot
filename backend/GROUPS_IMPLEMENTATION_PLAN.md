# NetPilot Commands-Server Groups Implementation Plan

## üéØ **Overview**

This plan outlines the implementation of group-based policy management in the commands-server over a 2-week sprint. The implementation follows a phased approach: establishing base infrastructure, then adding group support to existing features, and finally implementing new group-enabled features.

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Timeline: 2-Week Sprint**

- **Week 1**: Phases 1-3 (Base infrastructure + existing feature integration)
- **Week 2**: Phases 4-5 (New features + testing/optimization)

## üìã **Working Guidelines**

**Critical Development Principles:**

1. **üö´ No Sequential Thinking MCP**: Do not use the sequential thinking MCP tool. Think and plan before implementing, but make decisions directly and implement without using sequential thinking tools.

2. **üéØ Step-by-Step Execution**: Work methodically through each task in order. Complete one subtask fully before moving to the next.

3. **üîç Targeted Changes**: Make focused, specific changes that address exactly what is requested. Avoid scope creep or unnecessary modifications.

4. **üìå Stay On Task**: Perform only what is explicitly asked for in each subtask. Do not add extra features, optimizations, or "improvements" unless specifically required.

5. **‚úÖ Complete Before Moving**: Mark each checkbox only when the subtask is fully implemented and tested.

6. **üß™ Test Immediately**: Test each component as soon as it's implemented, before moving to dependent components. Create unit tests in the `tests/` folder with proper structure: `tests/unit/` for unit tests, `tests/integration/` for integration tests.

- [x] Add policy-related dataclasses (`BandwidthPolicy`, `AccessControlPolicy`, `TimeBasedPolicy`)
- [x] Create `PolicyAction` enum

## üéØ **Phase 1 Completion Summary**

**‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETED** - All foundational components implemented and tested.

### Key Achievements:
- **Complete Data Architecture**: All 9 dataclasses created with proper typing and validation
- **StateFileManager Singleton**: 750+ line centralized state manager with comprehensive CRUD operations
- **New State Format**: Group-based JSON structure replacing legacy format entirely
- **TC Class Management**: Automatic allocation/release system for traffic control classes (1:100+)
- **Device Validation**: IP/MAC format validation, duplicate prevention across groups
- **Group 0 Protection**: Guest Group (ID 0) pre-configured and deletion-protected
- **Infrastructure Integration**: Updated `infrastructure_setup.py` to use new StateFileManager

### Architecture Decisions Made:
- **No Backward Compatibility**: Legacy services will be completely replaced due to IP marking conflicts
- **Bandwidth Policy**: `null` = unrestricted, `<number>` = TC rule applied to all group members
- **Request-Scoped StateFileManager**: Each request gets its own StateFileManager instance via Flask's `g` object to prevent race conditions
- **Group-Based Paradigm**: Eliminates whitelist/blacklist mode separation in favor of per-group policies

### Critical Race Condition Fix Required:
**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Current singleton StateFileManager has race condition in multi-router environment:
- Shared `_cached_state` across all requests can mix router data
- Single instance serves multiple concurrent router requests
- Thread switching can cause Router X data to be written to Router Y

**SOLUTION**: Request-scoped StateFileManager instances:
- Create StateFileManager per request in Flask's `g` object  
- Each instance has isolated cache for its router
- RouterConnectionManager already handles router routing via `g.router_id`
- No shared state between concurrent requests

### Technical Foundation:
- **20+ Unit Tests**: Full test coverage with mocking for router operations
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Device format checking, duplicate detection, state structure validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks with default state creation
- **Performance Optimized**: Cached state with timestamp validation

**Ready for Phase 2**: State file infrastructure migration and Group 0 setup.
