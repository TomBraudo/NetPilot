# NetPilot Commands Server Transformation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan details the transformation of the existing Flask backend from a localhost application to a **Commands Server** that runs on the VM (34.38.207.87) and routes SSH commands to routers via established tunnels using session-based connection management with routerId lookup through the port-manager.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### âœ… What We Have
- **Flask Backend**: Complete API endpoints for NetPilot operations
- **Service Layer**: All NetPilot functionality (blocking, scanning, wifi management, etc.)
- **SSH Execution**: Uses `ssh_manager.execute_command()` with paramiko for direct connections
- **Port Manager**: Running on VM with router credential storage and port allocation
- **Agent Tunnel System**: Establishes reverse SSH tunnels with unique routerIds

### ðŸŽ¯ Transformation Goal
Transform the backend into a **Commands Server** where:
- API calls include `sessionId` and `routerId` parameters
- Server maintains session-based connection pools for multi-user support
- Each user session can manage multiple router connections simultaneously
- Automatic connection lifecycle management with configurable timeouts
- Server queries port-manager to get tunnel port and credentials for each routerId
- SSH commands are executed via persistent paramiko connections through tunnel ports
- All existing business logic and service structure remains unchanged

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Current)
```
API Call â†’ Endpoint â†’ Service â†’ ssh_manager (paramiko) â†’ Direct Router SSH
```

### After (Session-Based Commands Server)
```
User Login â†’ Session Start â†’ API Call (+ sessionId + routerId) â†’ Endpoint â†’ 
Service â†’ RouterConnectionManager â†’ Session-Aware Connection Pool â†’ 
Port Manager Lookup â†’ Persistent Paramiko via Tunnel â†’ Router SSH (port 22)
```

## Connection Management Architecture

### Session-Based Connection Pool Design

The commands server maintains an **in-memory, session-aware connection pool** that provides:

**Multi-User Isolation**: Each user session gets completely isolated connection management
**Multi-Router Support**: Each session can maintain connections to multiple routers simultaneously  
**Automatic Lifecycle Management**: Connections are created on-demand, reused for performance, and cleaned up automatically

### Connection Pool Structure

**Memory-Based Storage**: No local database required - all connection state maintained in memory with structured cleanup
**Thread-Safe Operations**: Connection pool operations are protected with threading locks for concurrent access
**Hierarchical Organization**: `{session_id: {router_id: connection_data}}`

### Connection Lifecycle Management

**Connection Creation**: 
- Triggered on first command to a router within a session
- Port-manager queried for tunnel port and credentials
- Paramiko connection established to localhost:tunnel_port
- Connection stored in session's router pool

**Connection Reuse**:
- Subsequent commands to same router reuse existing connection
- Connection health validated before each use
- Dead connections automatically detected and recreated

**Automatic Cleanup**:
- Individual router connections: Closed after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Entire sessions: Removed after 30 minutes of total inactivity
- Background cleanup thread runs continuously
- Explicit session termination on user logout

### Storage Requirements

**No Local Database Needed**: 
- All connection state maintained in memory
- Port-manager handles credential storage
- Session data ephemeral by design
- Configuration via environment variables

**Memory Footprint**:
- Each paramiko connection: ~1-2MB memory overhead
- Typical session (3 routers): ~5MB total
- 100 concurrent users: ~500MB memory usage
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks

**High Availability Considerations**:
- Commands server restart clears all sessions (by design)
- Users automatically reconnect on next command
- No persistent state to backup or restore

## Session Management Integration

### Frontend Integration Flow
- User authentication creates unique sessionId in auth server
- Frontend calls session start endpoint with sessionId
- All router commands include sessionId and routerId parameters
- Periodic session refresh calls maintain active session status
- User logout triggers explicit session termination

### Backend Integration (Auth + DB Server)
- Login endpoint creates sessionId and starts commands server session
- Logout endpoint terminates commands server session
- Session token validation includes sessionId for commands server context
- User database stores sessionId association for audit and tracking

### Connection Lifecycle
- **Session Start**: User logs in â†’ Backend starts session â†’ Commands server initializes session pool
- **Active Usage**: Commands execute on persistent connections â†’ Connections automatically refreshed on use
- **Idle Detection**: 5 minutes no activity â†’ Individual router connections closed automatically
- **Session Timeout**: 30 minutes total inactivity â†’ Entire session removed with all connections
- **Explicit Logout**: User logs out â†’ All session connections immediately closed

## API Specification

### Session Management Endpoints
```
POST /api/session/start     # Body: {sessionId}
POST /api/session/end       # Body: {sessionId}  
POST /api/session/refresh   # Body: {sessionId}
```

### Commands Server Endpoints

All endpoints require `sessionId` and `routerId` parameters to identify user session and target router.

#### Network Operations
```
GET  /api/blocked?sessionId={uuid}&routerId={uuid}
POST /api/block                    # Body: {sessionId, routerId, ip}
POST /api/unblock                  # Body: {sessionId, routerId, ip}
POST /api/reset                    # Body: {sessionId, routerId}
GET  /api/scan?sessionId={uuid}&routerId={uuid}

GET  /api/blacklist?sessionId={uuid}&routerId={uuid}
POST /api/blacklist/add            # Body: {sessionId, routerId, ip, ...}
POST /api/blacklist/remove         # Body: {sessionId, routerId, ip}
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Router Identification Flow
1. API call includes sessionId (from auth server) and routerId (from agent)
2. Commands server queries port-manager for router allocation by routerId
3. Port-manager returns tunnel port and stored router credentials
4. Commands server establishes or reuses paramiko connection to localhost:tunnel_port
5. SSH command executed on persistent connection with automatic timeout handling

### Error Handling
- **Router Not Found**: 404 if routerId not found in port-manager
- **Session Invalid**: 401 if sessionId not active or expired
- **Tunnel Down**: 503 if SSH connection fails or tunnel unavailable
- **Command Timeout**: 408 if command execution exceeds configured timeout
- **Invalid Parameters**: 400 for malformed requests or missing required fields

### Security Considerations
- Commands server accessible only from localhost and authenticated cloud backend
- No direct router credentials stored in commands server memory
- All credentials retrieved from port-manager on-demand for each new connection
- SSH commands executed with strict timeout limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Session isolation prevents cross-user access to router connections

## Testing Checklist

## Estimated Timeline

- **Week 1**: Phase 1-2 (Core infrastructure + API modifications)
- **Week 2**: Phase 3-4 (Service updates + comprehensive testing)  
- **Week 3**: Phase 5 (Deployment + production validation)

**Total**: 3 weeks for complete transformation

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional**: All existing NetPilot operations work via session-based commands server
2. **Performance**: Command execution <2s for 90% of operations with connection reuse
3. **Scalable**: Multiple users can manage multiple routers simultaneously without interference
4. **Reliable**: Commands server handles tunnel disconnections and session timeouts gracefully  
5. **Resource Efficient**: Automatic connection cleanup prevents memory leaks and resource exhaustion
6. **Maintainable**: Minimal changes to existing business logic with clear session management layer

This transformation creates a robust, session-aware commands server that leverages your existing tunnel infrastructure while providing the multi-user, multi-router support required for the web application architecture. The session-based design ensures efficient resource usage while maintaining the high-performance SSH execution that NetPilot operations require.
