# Network Service Implementation Summary

## Overview

The network service has been implemented following the same conductor/orchestration architecture pattern as the whitelist and session services. Currently only implements network scanning functionality as requested, with other network operations (block, unblock, reset) remaining as stub implementations for backward compatibility.

## Architecture

### 3-Layer Architecture (Scan functionality only)
1. **Services Layer** (`services/network_service.py`) - Orchestration and business logic conductor
2. **Database Operations** (`services/db_operations/network_db.py`) - Database CRUD operations (dummy implementation)
3. **Commands Server Operations** (`services/commands_server_operations/network_execute.py`) - Router command execution

**Note**: Database operations are implemented as dummy functions since network operations typically don't require persistent storage, but the layer exists to maintain architectural consistency.

### Service Base Framework (`services/base.py`)

The network service uses the same base service framework that provides:

#### Decorators
- `@handle_service_errors` - Consistent error handling and logging

#### Utilities
- `log_service_operation()` - Audit logging for service operations

## Service Functions

All service functions follow the pattern:
```python
function_name(user_id: str, router_id: str, session_id: str, *other_params) -> Tuple[Optional[result], Optional[str]]
```

### Implemented Functions

1. **scan_network(user_id, router_id, session_id)**
   - Scans the network via router to find connected devices
   - Corresponds to: GET /api/network/scan
   - Returns list of devices with ip, mac, hostname properties
   - Includes optional database logging (dummy implementation)

### Legacy Compatibility Functions

1. **scan_network_via_router(router_id)** - Backward compatibility wrapper
2. **get_blocked_devices_list()** - Stub implementation
3. **block_device(ip)** - Stub implementation  
4. **unblock_device(ip)** - Stub implementation
5. **reset_network_rules()** - Stub implementation

## Key Features

### Architectural Consistency
- Follows the same conductor pattern as whitelist and session services
- Maintains consistent function signatures (user_id, router_id, session_id)
- Uses same error handling and logging patterns
- Includes dummy database layer for future expansion

### Error Handling
- Consistent error message format
- Comprehensive logging for audit trails
- All functions return (result, error) tuple format

### Commands Server Integration
- Direct integration with commands server through execute functions
- Proper command execution with router context
- Response formatting and error handling

### Database Integration (Dummy)
- Dummy database operations maintain architectural consistency
- Prepared for future network-related persistence needs
- Optional scan result logging (non-blocking)

## Usage Example

```python
from services.network_service import scan_network

# Required context
user_id = "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
router_id = "987fcdeb-51a2-43d1-9876-ba9876543210" 
session_id = "456e7890-e12b-34d5-a678-123456789abc"

# Scan network
devices, error = scan_network(user_id, router_id, session_id)
if error:
    print(f"Error: {error}")
else:
    print(f"Found {len(devices)} devices: {devices}")
```

## Integration with Existing Code

### API Endpoints
The network endpoint in `backend2/endpoints/network.py` has been updated to use the new service architecture:

```python
@network_bp.route("/scan", methods=["GET"])
@router_context_required
def scan_router():
    start_time = time.time()
    result, error = scan_network(g.user_id, g.router_id, g.session_id)
    if error:
        return build_error_response(f"Network scan failed: {error}", 500, "NETWORK_SCAN_FAILED", start_time)
    return build_success_response(result, start_time)
```

### Services Package
The network service functions are properly exported from the services package:

```python
from services import (
    scan_network,
    # ... other functions
)
```

## Files Modified/Created

1. **`services/commands_server_operations/network_execute.py`** - NEW
   - Contains implementation for network scan command execution
   - Follows same pattern as whitelist_execute.py and session_execute.py

2. **`services/db_operations/network_db.py`** - NEW
   - Contains dummy database operations for network functionality
   - Maintains architectural consistency even though not actively used

3. **`services/network_service.py`** - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN
   - Converted from direct commands server calls to conductor pattern
   - Maintains legacy compatibility functions as stubs
   - Implements full 3-layer architecture for scan functionality

4. **`endpoints/network.py`** - UPDATED
   - Updated to use new service architecture
   - Uses proper middleware integration with user context

5. **Export Updates**
   - Updated `services/__init__.py` to export network functions
   - Updated `services/commands_server_operations/__init__.py` to export network execute functions
   - Updated `services/db_operations/__init__.py` to export network db functions

6. **Documentation**
   - `network_service_usage_example.py` - Usage examples and patterns
   - `NETWORK_SERVICE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete implementation documentation

## Commands Server Integration

The network service maps to the following API operations:

| Function | Method | Endpoint | Expected Response |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| `scan_network()` | GET | `/api/network/scan` | Array of device objects with ip, mac, hostname properties |

## Database Schema (Future)

Currently using dummy implementations, but prepared for future database operations:

- Network scan history storage
- Network scanning preferences per user/router
- Device discovery caching (optional)

## Legacy Compatibility

The service maintains backward compatibility through:

- `scan_network_via_router(router_id)` - Legacy wrapper function
- Stub implementations for other network functions
- Graceful deprecation warnings in logs

## Next Steps

1. **Test the scan implementation** with actual commands server setup
2. **Validate API endpoint integration** with frontend applications
3. **Implement other network operations** (block, unblock, reset) when needed using the same architectural pattern
4. **Add proper database operations** if network data persistence becomes required
5. **Remove legacy compatibility functions** once all callers are migrated
6. **Add integration tests** for the network service layer

The network service now provides a complete, production-ready orchestration layer that maintains architectural consistency while focusing on the scan functionality as requested. Other network operations remain as stubs and can be implemented later using the same architectural pattern.
