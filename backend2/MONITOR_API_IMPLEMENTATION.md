# Backend Monitor API Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the complete backend monitor API in backend2 with all required endpoints. The implementation follows the same patterns and architecture as the existing settings and network endpoints.

## Implemented Endpoints

### 1. GET /api/monitor/current

- **Description**: Get usage information about all devices from today
- **Response**: List of device objects with connections, download, upload, ip, mac, and unit fields

### 2. GET /api/monitor/last-week

- **Description**: Get usage information about all devices from the last week
- **Response**: List of device objects with connections, download, upload, ip, mac, and unit fields

### 3. GET /api/monitor/last-month

- **Description**: Get usage information about all devices from the last month
- **Response**: List of device objects with connections, download, upload, ip, mac, and unit fields

### 4. GET /api/monitor/device/<mac>

- **Description**: Get usage information about a specific device by MAC address
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `period` (optional): "current", "week", or "month" (defaults to "current")
- **Response**: Single device object with connections, download, upload, ip, mac, and unit fields

## Expected Response Format

All endpoints return data in this format:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "connections": 25,
      "download": 1500.5,
      "upload": 342.1,
      "ip": "192.168.1.100",
      "mac": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
      "unit": "MB"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "routerId": "router-123",
    "sessionId": "session-456",
    "period": "current"
  }
}
```

## Architecture

### 1. Endpoints Layer (`endpoints/monitor.py`)

- Flask blueprint with `/api/monitor` prefix
- Uses `@router_context_required` middleware for authentication and router context
- Proper error handling and response formatting
- Logging for all operations

### 2. Service Layer (`services/monitor_service.py`)

- Business logic and orchestration
- Validates parameters (period, MAC address)
- Calls commands server operations
- Error handling with `@handle_service_errors` decorator

### 3. Commands Server Operations (`services/commands_server_operations/monitor_execute.py`)

- Direct communication with cloud command server
- Uses `@with_commands_server` and `@handle_commands_errors` decorators
- Forwards requests to command server endpoints:
  - `/api/monitor/current`
  - `/api/monitor/last-week`
  - `/api/monitor/last-month`
  - `/api/monitor/device/{mac}?period={period}`

## Integration

- Monitor blueprint is registered in `server.py`
- Uses same authentication and middleware patterns as existing endpoints
- Communicates with command server using session_id and router_id
- Consistent error handling and response formatting

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:

1. `endpoints/monitor.py` - Flask blueprint with all monitor endpoints
2. `services/monitor_service.py` - Business logic for monitor operations
3. `services/commands_server_operations/monitor_execute.py` - Command server communication
4. `test_monitor_endpoints.py` - Test script for endpoint validation

### Modified Files:

1. `server.py` - Added monitor blueprint import and registration

## Testing

- Basic server initialization test passes
- All endpoints are properly configured
- Ready for integration testing with actual command server
- Test script provided for manual endpoint testing

## Next Steps

1. Integration testing with live command server
2. Verify response format matches frontend expectations
3. Add unit tests if needed
4. Performance testing under load

The implementation is complete and follows all existing patterns in the codebase for consistency and maintainability.
